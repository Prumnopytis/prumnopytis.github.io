#+DESCRIPTION: Expressing my dislike of Python
* Why am I a Python programmer?

I spent a summer reviewing and coding foreground Matlab implementations of image segmentation algorithms.

Python was not a proprietary language and at the time I observed the scipy stack had happened to  move a little faster on some algorithms I cared about.

Coming from Matlab-physics, similar Python module APIs were similar.

* Why do I dislike Python?

| Bash seems better at being sh than Python is                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R seems better for conveniently exposing C and Fortran than Python is |

* Python being useful

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pygame
#+END_EXAMPLE
and
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install ansible
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.nfs
#+END_EXAMPLE
for example.

| Built in virtual environment module       |
| (Using something in shell is still shell) |
| Built in package manager has a lot        |

* Python as a language

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
def getfizzbuzz(n):
    listToPrint=[]

    if n % 3 is 0:
        listToPrint+=["Fizz"]

    if n % 5 == 0:
        listToPrint.append(
            "Buzz",
	)

    if listToPrint: return ''.join(listToPrint[::]);
    else: 
        return n

for fizzresponse in [ getfizzbuzz(n=n-1) for n in range(2, 102, 1) ]: print(fizzresponse);
#+END_EXAMPLE

That got a little silly.
